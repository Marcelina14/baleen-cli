Helper Set
==========

.. php:namespace:: Baleen\Cli\Container

Service Name: :php:const:`Services::HELPERSET`

The :php:class:`HelperSetProvider` supplies the :php:class:`Application` with a
``Symfony\Component\Console\Helper\HelperSet``. The individual helpers are also registered as services to allow for
easier customization.

Customizing the HelperSet
-------------------------

If only the question or config helpers need to be customized then simply override their service. Otherwise its
recommended to replace the :php:class:`HelperSetProvider` class entirely in order to customize the HelperSet service.
