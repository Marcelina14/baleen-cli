Storage
=======

Service Name: ``Services::STORAGE``

The Storage service must implement :php:interface:`StorageInterface`, and we recommend that it additionally extends
:php:class:`Baleen\Migrations\Storage\AbstractStorage`. For more information on how to implement
:php:interface:`StorageInterface` please refer to the Baleen Migrations documentation.

The default Storage service implementation is the :php:class:`FileStorage` class, which saves versions into a local
file. The file's location can be specified using the configuration option "storage.file", and defaults to
:file:`.baleen_versions`.
