Comparator
==========

.. php:namespace:: Baleen\Cli\Container

Service Name: :php:const:`Services::COMPARATOR`

The comparator is simply an invokable class that receives two Versions as arguments by implementing
``Baleen\Migrations\Version\Comparator\ComparatorInterface``. The reason its a class is that we preferred to make sure
we had control over the comparator's signature - if we had accepted closures we would have forced implementations to
make many unnecessary argument type-checks.

When invoked, the comparator must return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than 0 (zero) in order to indicate
if the first version is earlier than, equal to, or later than the second version (respectively). By earlier/later we
refer to the order in which the versions should be executed.

The Comparator service is used at different points in the domain logic so its useful to have it as a service.

The default comparator used by Baleen CLI is an instance of ``Baleen\Migrations\Version\Comparator\DefaultComparator``.
The service is registered by default in the :php:class:`TimelineProvider`.
