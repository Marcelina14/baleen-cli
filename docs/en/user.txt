Installation
============

Install with Composer:

.. code-block:: bash

   composer install baleen/cli

Configuration
=============

Then run the following command on the root directory of the project you want to migrate:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./vendor/bin baleen init

This will create a configuration file called `.baleen.yml` and a storage file at `.baleen_versions`. You should put
the config file under version control, but not the storage file.

Why a storage file instead of a database table? Baleen is database-agnostic. That's where YOU come in: you can customize
Baleen CLI to use any other type of storage you can imagine. A local file is just the default we decided to ship with.

Usage
=====

Creating Migrations
-------------------

Creating a migration is very easy, just run:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./vendor/bin baleen create what_it_does # the last argument is optional
   # or: ./vendor/bin baleen migrations:create what_it_does

A new migration file will be created inside your configured migrations folder.

Note that Baleen CLI uses PSR-4 standards for autoloading the generated migrations out of the configured migrations
directory. The file names must conform to the following regex: ``YYYYMMDDHHMMSS[_A-Za-z0-9]+``

More advanced users could even overwrite the class generator to fit their needs.

Adding Your Code
----------------

If you open that file you'll see it has two empty methods: ``up()`` and ``down()``, which will be called when migrating
upwards or downwards (respectively). You can put any code you want inside those methods - for example code to
transform your database, an image, a document, etc. - anything you want to migrate!
