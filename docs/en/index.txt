Welcome to Baleen CLI's documentation!

Baleen CLI is a command-line wrapper that uses Symfony Console and leverages the power of Baleen Migrations. Its primary
purpose is to provide out-of-the-box functionality for Baleen Migrations. But thanks to its flexible architecture it can
also be used as a starting point for your own migrations library.
