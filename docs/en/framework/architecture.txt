Architecture
============

Baleen CLI uses a series of 3rd-party components to power its functionality and make it as flexible as possible. Here's
a quick overview of the main components being used and how. Throughout the rest of the guide we will assume you know
how those components work, so we recommend reading up on each component's documentation on an as-needed basis.

Core Components
---------------

The Baleen CLI framework uses ``League\Container`` as an extensible service layer. This allows for easy customization of
almost every aspect of the framework.

For the command-line interface we use ``Symfony\Console``. You probably wouldn't be reading this if you didn't know
about it.

For filesystem operations (e.g. reading a configuration file) we use ``League\Flysystem``.

We use ``Symfony\Config`` to define and validate configuration schemas, as well as reading and merging config files .

We also use ``League\Tactician``, read about Commands for more details.

Configuration
-------------

The Baleen CLI framework allows you to easily define your configuration's schema using ``Symfony\Config`` definitions.
A default schema is provided that covers the basic structure.

Migrations
----------

Migrations are powered by the Baleen Migrations "domain library", and therefore a lot of the architectural concepts
from that library also apply to Baleen CLI. We recommend reading up on the Baleen Migrations documentation for a better
understanding of how this library works. For example, you might want to know what the "Storage" is meant to do.
