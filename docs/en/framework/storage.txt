Storage
=======

Service Name: ``Services::STORAGE``

The Storage service must implement ``Baleen\Migrations\Storage\StorageInterface``, and we recommend that it
additionally extends ``Baleen\Migrations\Storage\AbstractStorage``. For more information on how to implement
``StorageInterface`` please refer to the Baleen Migrations documentation.

The default Storage service implementation is the ``Baleen\Migrations\Storage\FileStorage`` class, which saves versions
into a local file. The file's location can be specified using the configuration option "storage.file", and defaults to
".baleen_versions".
