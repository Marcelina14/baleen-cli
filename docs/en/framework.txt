Framework Guide
===============

Baleen CLI can perform migrations on its own, but it was also built as a framework that can help developers build their
own migrations library without worrying about migrations boilerplate.

The purpose of this section is to show how developers can use the Baleen CLI framework in order to supply a migrations
library for their own framework or application.
